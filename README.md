0. I was able to run a test at the first link sourced below (coolors.co) to see
how accessible the background and text color combinations were and the result 
was a 2.74 or "very poor" (1/5 stars) for both small text and large text. After
swapping out the background0 color for white (#ffffff) I ran the same test with the 
new background color replacing the old one, this time the site scored a 14.09, "super",
(5/5 stars) for color contrast and color accessiblity.

1. Spacebar sends the scroll bar to the bottom of the screen, tab seems to work moderately 
well, but skips to the elements at the bottom of the screen prior to the links located on 
the right which jolts your vision straight downard in a harsh fashion. Arrow keys allow
the user to scroll. There aren't any fantastic options for a user to navigate the article
either.

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:
